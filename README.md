# Load Management System

This repository contains the code for the implementation of an automated load management system for residential buildings

## About

In this project, an effective algorithm was used to design a demand side management system that will automatically control residential loads based on preset on and off periods. Several components of hardware were developed in order to test and validate this algorithm. These components included: a microcontroller, four-channel relay module, step-down transformer, Liquid Crystal display, and a DS1340C real-time clock module. By utilizing a 4-channel relay module that serves as a switch, the microcontroller has the capability of automating the process of turning on and off loads based on the current time.

To make use of this system, the user sets the followin parameters:
• Time On (the time the load can be turned on or the time the load might be required)
• Time Off (the time the load won't be required from)
• Category (select whether the load is critical or non-critical)
